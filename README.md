# Introduction

`opsh` is a scripting environment designed for operations use.  At its core it is:

- a subset of POSIX shell syntax and semantics
- a superset of shell functionality provided by built-in libraries
- non-interactive, designed specifically for scripting

The goal is to be pragmatically compatible with your existing shell scripts, while improving the ergonomics and reliability of writing shell.

# Goals

- [X] - Prototype using `bash` as the runtime
- [ ] - Native interpreter
- [ ] - Linting and Language Server
- [ ] - Formatting
- [ ] - Static compiler/linker (for single 'binary' deployments)

# License

`opsh` is licensed under the GPLv3, included in this repository.  This license applies to code that is part of the core `opsh` distribution, but does extend into scripts written by end users.
